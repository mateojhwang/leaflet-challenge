2. In this challenge I used this website, https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php, to get earthquake data in geoJSON format. I then retrieved data about the magnitude, depth, location and time and portrayed that on a map. The size of the markers reflect the magnitude while the color reflects the depth. I also created a popup that provides additional information when clicked.

3. In order to view the map, please download the liveserver extension on VS-Code.
